			<div class="about">
			<p> <b>98%</b> of all perpetrators of sexual violence will <b>not spend a single day in prison</b> <a href="https://www.rainn.org/statistics/criminal-justice-system">(RAINN - 2017, retrieved from Gordon).</a></p>
			<p> <b>68%</b> of survivors choose <b>not to report their abuser</b> and engage in criminal legal processes (RAINN, retrieved from Gordon).</p>
			<p>"Prisons do not work to transform the conditions that cause violence (rather the opposite)... People who abuse usually do not receive treatment or services in prison that help them to change their abusive behaviors and patterns, and they are typically not held accountable to those they hurt." (Gordon) </p>

		<h2> <i> What is restorative justice? </i> </h2>

		<p>Restorative justice, also known as transformative justice, is a way of approaching conflict in a way that does not simply punish offenders, but makes them face the people they harmed (Costello et. al, 7). Restorative justice seeks to identify what harm was done (to all parties involved), what each member of the community needs, and what the parties involved can do to repair relationships and the community. It uses community accountability to "solve problems without the use of police and state systems, because we are very often pushed out of those systems or criminalized if we try to act within those systems" states founder of Just Practice, Shira Hassan (Jaffe). </p>

		<p> This can be a difficult concept to imagine, especially with how emotionally charged the issue of sexual violence is. However, consider the following community after Person A had commited sexual assault against Person B: </p>

		<table>
		  <thead>
		    <tr>
		      <th>Community Member</th>
		      <th>Emotional Impact</th>
		    </tr>
		  </thead>
		  <tbody>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Person A</td>
		      <td>shame over their actions</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Person B</td>
		      <td>fear that Person A will assault them again</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Person B's Family Member</td>
		      <td>anger at the actions of Person A</td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Sexual Assault Survivor in Community</td>
		      <td>response from community causes a re-traumaization </td>
		    </tr>
		    <tr>
		      <td>Friend to Person A</td>
		      <td>sadness about how the assault will affect their relationship with A</td>
		    </tr>
		  </tbody>
		</table>

		<p> From the above illustration, we can see that even if the sexual assault case was handled in a courtroom, there would still be many people whose hurt would not be addressed. It is sometimes said that restorative practices are <b>not</b> <i>TO</i> people or <i>FOR</i> people, but <i>WITH</i> people (Costello et. al, 50). </p>

		<h2>What are the outcomes of restorative justice?</h2>

		<p>"You can’t force somebody into being accountable for things they do. That is not possible. People have to take accountability for things that they actually do wrong. They have to decide that this is wrong. <b>They have to say, 'This is wrong and I want to be part of making some sort of amends or repairing this or not doing it again.'</b>... We have to make community members understand what sexual harm looks like, what it feels like, why it is unacceptable. <b>We have to make violence unthinkable in our culture.</b> We have to make interpersonal violence unthinkable. It has to become that. This is not about punishment, but about organizing. Most people don’t want to organize around these things. That, to me, is the nexus. That is the place that we have to work from if we are really going to transform this into something where it isn’t the survivors or the victims who have to carry the load all the time." - Mariame Kaba (Jaffe) </p>
