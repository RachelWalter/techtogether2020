			<h2>About the Project</h2>
			<p>This project is a submission to <a href="https://boston.techtogether.io/">TechTogether Boston</a>, a gender-focused hackathon that aims to empower women through technology. I wanted to provide resources to survivors of sexual violence, as well as provide a review and visualization of public data on sexual violence and provide an alternative system of dealing with the aftermath of sexual violence through a beginner's guide to Restoratrive Justice.</p>
			<p>The source code of this website and my data analysis is available on my <a href="https://github.com/RachelWalter/techtogether2020">GitHub</a>. My data science tools included Jupyter Notebooks and Python (especially the pandas, matplotlib, and folium libraries). I coded the website using HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. Some features of this site are widgets created by other organizations focused on sexual violence; these widgets are credited accordingly. The iconography in the Restorative Justice Approach section are my original works created with Adobe Photoshop.</p>
			<h2>About the Creator</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Rachel Walter. I am a 2019 graduate of University of Maryland, College Park with a major in computer science and a minor in women's studies. I am thrilled that I have had the opportunity to combine my two interests into one project that could have a genuine utility to educate others on sexual violence and restorative practices. In addition to coding, I enjoy reading, latin dancing, and running my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rachelsafoodie/?hl=en">food instagram</a></p>
